## Description

Virtual List efficiently displays large lists of items by displaying only those items that fit on the screen. Loading hundreds of elements in any browser can be slow; Virtual scrolling allows you to effectively simulate all displayed elements by making the height of the container element the same as the height of the total number of elements being displayed, and then rendering only the visible elements. Virtual scrolling is different from strategies like infinite scrolling, where it displays a set number of items and then renders the rest when you reach the end.
